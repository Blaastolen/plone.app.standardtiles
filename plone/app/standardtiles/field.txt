Field Tile
==========

A field tile is a very simple tile: it just displays a field of its context
honoring the widget customizations present in the schema tagged values; but it
doesn't take into account the other tagged values such as when to display
something or not, as this is both useless from a tile point-of-view, and causes
harm due to certain default settings of behaviours.

Let's then proceed and see how the field tile works. First of all, let's set up
a bit of boilerplate: ::

    >>> from plone.testing.z2 import Browser
    >>> app = layer['app']
    >>> browser = Browser(app)
    >>> browser.handleErrors = False
    >>> content = layer['portal']['deco-test-type1']
    >>> import transaction

We now have a browser and a test content, which uses a very simple content type
we have defined that has the following fields (see ``tests/schemata.py`` for
details):

textfield
    A textline field

intfield
    An integer field

boolfield
    A boolean field

We can then try to set the textfield and try to render the tile that
displays it: ::

    >>> content.textfield = u"Hello world"
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> browser.open(content.absolute_url() + '/@@plone.app.standardtiles.field?field=textfield')
    >>> browser.contents
    '...<span id="form-widgets-textfield" ...>Hello world</span>...'
